Angular 1.x/Browserify component and app Yeoman generator

#Usage

Install Yeoman

```
npm install -g yo
```

This generator is currently not available on npm, so to get started, clone this repository locally.

In the root of the repository, run:

```
npm install
```

and then

```
npm link
```

The generator will now be available locally.  Run the component sub generator using:

```
yo angular-browserify:component my-new-component
```

Using the argument as a name, this command will create a new directory and boilerplate files for your component:

```
my-new-component/
    my-new-component.html
    my-new-component.js
    my-new-component.less
```

#Options

###Components

When creating a new component, you will be prompted with two questions:

* Would you like to include a LESS file? (self explanatory...)</li>
* What would you like to call the main function in this component?</li>

This will name the outer wrapper function of the component, and construct the name of the controller function within the component.

###Services

When creating a new service, you will be prompted with two questions:

* What would you like to call the service? (Default: *NewService*)</li>
* What is the output subdirectory? (Default: *services*)</li>

This will name the outer wrapper function of the service, and create the service file in the specified subdirectory.
